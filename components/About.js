					<p className="py-4 text-gray-600">
						I'm a Full Stack web developer with rich experience developing complete web apps 
						and websites based on JavaScript using React.js and Next.js as my main frontend 
						framework. I have also experience with node.js for backend support along with all 
						the logic projects need including database and API support. I am a dedicated developer 
						with a commitment to perfect development works I work on. I enjoy making iterative 
						improvements until a project I work on gets completed with the best results. 
						I'm also passionate about teaching, especially programming and computer science, 
						and I have worked with college students, high schools, and others alike.
